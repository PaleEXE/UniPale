Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight

I can't believe all the things I just said
To me tonight, to me tonight, to me tonight
Stars are descending, the street signs go by
A lonely ride, I need to cry to feel alive

You pull me close and knock me down
Then I beg to come back around
I'm so addicted to your lies, ooh
And in the mirror I get weak
At the girl staring back at me
They're your eyes, they're your eyes

Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care
Don't call tonight, tomorrow you'll deserve me
I can hear everythin' you're saying from here
Don't call tonight, don't call tonight

Saturday morning, my head is on fire
It's hard to blame you for your crimes when I have mine
The Sun is rising, but we're out of light
We twist the knife too many times to say goodbye

You pull me close and knock me down
Then I beg to come back around
I'm so addicted to your lies, ooh
And in the mirror I get weak
At the girl staring back at me
They're your eyes, they're your eyes

Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care
Don't call tonight, tomorrow you'll deserve me
I can hear everythin' you're saying from here
Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight
Ooh-oh
Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight

(Drivin' home to your favorite song)
(And you scream so loud, 'cause you're all alone)
(And your heart beats fast 'cause you're in the zone)
(And you know you got where you belong, and)
Drivin' home to your favorite song
And you scream so loud, 'cause you're all alone
And your heart beats fast 'cause you're in the zone
And then you hear the phone

Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care
Don't call tonight, tomorrow you'll deserve me
I can hear everythin' you're saying from here
Don't call tonight

Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care
Don't call tonight, tomorrow you'll deserve me
I can hear everythin' you're saying from here
Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight
Ooh-oh
Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight
Don't call tonight, yeah, oh-oh
Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight
