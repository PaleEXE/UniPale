In the club with some ones and I'm piped up
Shawty got me high, too high
I be steppin' on a bitch in some white ones
Can't control me, I think I'm too fly, high
Tore up, tore up, tore up, tore up
Tore up, tore up (high), tore up, tore up
Tore up, tore up (ah), tore up, tore up
Tore up, tore up (high), tore up, tore up
She back to back, oh, she in that mode (woo)
I rip her tracks out, she gotta go
I hop up on my bike, it's, "Peace and adios"
It's not about where you're at, it's where you go
If you believe in yourself
It will get you through it
Oh, I believed in myself
Well, can you see what I'm doin'?
In the club with some ones and I'm piped up

Tore up, tore up, tore up, tore up
Tore up, tore up (high), tore up, tore up
Tore up, tore up (ah), tore up, tore up
