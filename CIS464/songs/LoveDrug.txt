River in my eyes
I've got a poem in my throat
I hear the music and it takes me by surprise
Pictures in my mind
They come on faster than they go
Another round hoping this one will make me blind
I know this time
I won't escape these thoughts in my head
I need you tonight
But I'm gonna fight the feeling instead
I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your lovedrug
I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your lovedrug
Your lovedrug
Thought we'd last a lifetime
When I'm mumblin' alone
I taste the last words that you spoke to me like wine
My heart is in a bind
If I could bear it on my own
I wouldn't try so hard to numb what's left behind
I know this time
I won't escape these thoughts that I dread
I need you tonight
But I'm gonna fight the feeling instead
I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your lovedrug
I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your lovedrug
Lovedrug
Need your love
Your lovedrug
Your lovedrug
Need your lovedrug
Need your lovedrug
Lovedrug
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your lovedrug
