So sad, watch good love go bad
Smoke from a distant, fire burning me
Oh babe, the heaven can't wait
I need these hints
I'm feeling, my heart's appealingï¼Œmy heart, is appealing
Sweet little Sheila
Do you, do you really want me?
Sophisticated lady want me
Sweet little Sheila
Do you, do you really love me?
She's a different baby to me
I only want Sheila
Oh, my Sheila
Oh, she's precious
Like the sun
I only want Sheila
Oh, my Sheila
She's drunk, she's foolish
And most fun
Oh, babe, for the promise you've made
Be careful they've got storms that you're afraid
Oh, babe, don't say it's too late
Words can't express my feelings, being believing
Sweet little Sheila
Do you, do you really want me?
Sophisticated lady want me
Sweet little Sheila
Do you, do you really love me?
She's a different baby to me
I only want Sheila
Oh, my Sheila
Oh, she's precious
Like the sun
I only want Sheila
Oh, my Sheila
She's drunk, she's foolish
And most fun
I only want Sheila
Oh, my Sheila
Oh, she's precious
Like the sun
I only want Sheila
